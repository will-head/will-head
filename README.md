I'm a recent graduate of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) Web Development Bootcamp, having worked in technology for my whole career: writing about it for magazines and websites, explaining it in videos that have been watched over 25 million times, to now creating it.

I've run my own company for many years, so I can to manage projects from inception to completion, working autonomously when required to assembling and managing a team to successfully deliver large projects on time and on budget.
